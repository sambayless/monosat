  Added stimulus and witness/counter example definitions to FORMAT report.

Version 20061115

  Made ASCII format default if output is connected to terminal.
  New delta debugger for AIG tools.
  New bounded model checker for AIGs.

Version 20061005
 
  Beta version and second public release.

  Renamed 'big' to 'aig' and 'aig' to 'aag' to reflect the fact that
  the old binary 'big' format is really the default format.  There is no
  '.big' file extension any more.

  Dropped second field in symbol table entries, since it was redundant.
